# §2.2 The δλ Formalism — Separated Pullback Metric and Frame-Lag Equations of Motion

## Executive Summary

This section develops the **δλ formalism**, which controls the degree to which spacetime and coherence-frame degrees of freedom are coupled. We introduce a **distinguishability parameter λ ∈ [0, 1]** that interpolates between the classical limit (λ = 0, where spacetime and coherence decouple) and the quantum regime (λ = 1, full coupling via T_{MΣ}).

Using λ, we decompose the pullback metric from the Fubini-Study structure on projective Hilbert space PH to the joint manifold M × Σ into three parts: a "pure-M" component (classical spacetime metric), a "pure-Σ" component (coherence-frame metric from Paper 1), and a controlled cross-term (proportional to T_{MΣ}, strength set by λ). We then derive the **Euler-Lagrange equations** from the action principle, obtaining frame-lag equations of motion that show how the coherence frame **lags behind** or **tracks** environmental decoherence depending on the magnitude of T_{MΣ}. Finally, we relate this formalism to the canonical 5D KK-Cone metric, showing how the warp factor A(r,z) modulates λ and hence the effective coupling between spacetime and coherence sectors.

## 2.2.1 The Distinguishability Parameter λ

### Motivation: Separating Classical and Quantum Sectors

From §2.1, the full metric on M × Σ is:

$$G_{AB} = \begin{pmatrix}
G_{\mu\nu} & T_{\mu a} \\
T_{a\mu} & G_{ab}
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Eq. 2.2.1**

When T_{MΣ} = 0, spacetime and coherence decouple, and we recover purely classical dynamics. The classical limit is not merely ℏ → 0 (which erases the coherence sector entirely), but rather a regime where the coherence frame cannot follow environmental variations—i.e., the system is unable to maintain quantum coherence and thus behaves classically.

The question is: **By what mechanism does T_{MΣ} become large or small?** The answer lies in the responsiveness of the coherence frame to environmental signals. If the coherence frame can adapt quickly to environmental changes, T_{MΣ} is large, and spacetime-frame coupling is strong. If the frame adaptation is slow or suppressed, T_{MΣ} is effectively small, and the system behaves classically.

We parameterize this responsiveness with a scalar field λ.

### Definition of λ

We define the **distinguishability parameter** as a scalar function on M × Σ:

$$\boxed{\lambda(x, \xi) \in [0, 1]}$$

**Eq. 2.2.2**

**Physical interpretation**:
- **λ = 0** (classical limit): The spacetime and coherence-frame sectors are completely distinguishable (separable). Environmental decoherence dominates. The coherence frame cannot track environmental variations. T_{MΣ} is effectively zero, and M and Σ decouple.
- **λ = 1** (quantum regime): The sectors are maximally coupled. The coherence frame can respond fully to environmental variations. T_{MΣ} is at its "natural" magnitude (determined by the Fubini-Study structure alone).
- **0 < λ < 1** (intermediate regime): Partial coupling. The coherence frame has limited adaptive capacity.

### Relation to T_{MΣ}

We propose that the effective cross-term in the action is controlled by λ:

$$T_{\mu a}^{\text{eff}} = \lambda(x, \xi) \, T_{\mu a}^{\text{FS}}(x, \xi)$$

**Eq. 2.2.3**

where:
- $T_{\mu a}^{\text{FS}}$ is the Fubini-Study cross-term computed in §2.1 (the "bare" geometric coupling)
- λ is the **suppression factor** that encodes how much of this coupling is actually realized in the dynamics

**Status**: The derivation of λ from first principles (e.g., from a decoherence-rate Lagrangian or from information-theoretic constraints) is deferred to future work. For now, λ is a phenomenological parameter whose value is determined by the local environment and the system's coupling strength to it.

### Classical Limit Behavior

As λ → 0:
- The effective cross-term vanishes: $T_{\mu a}^{\text{eff}} \to 0$.
- The metric becomes block-diagonal, and M and Σ decouple.
- The coherence frame "freezes" (ξ^a becomes a spectator coordinate).
- Spacetime dynamics reduces to standard geodesic motion.

---

## 2.2.2 The Separated Pullback Metric

### Block Decomposition in Terms of λ

With the effective cross-term defined, we rewrite the full metric as:

$$G_{AB}(λ) = \begin{pmatrix}
G_{\mu\nu} & \lambda T_{\mu a} \\
\lambda T_{a\mu} & G_{ab}
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Eq. 2.2.4**

We now decompose this into three parts: a "pure-M" part, a "pure-Σ" part, and a λ-controlled coupling.

### Separated Form

Define:
- **$G_{AB}^{(M)}$**: the metric if Σ is "turned off" (only spacetime coordinates vary)
- **$G_{AB}^{(Σ)}$**: the metric if M is "turned off" (only coherence-frame coordinates vary)
- **$G_{AB}^{(cross)}$**: the coupling term between M and Σ

Then:

$$G_{AB}(λ) = G_{AB}^{(M)} + G_{AB}^{(Σ)} + \lambda G_{AB}^{(cross)}$$

**Eq. 2.2.5**

**Explicitly**:

$$G_{AB}^{(M)} = \begin{pmatrix}
G_{\mu\nu} & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \quad G_{AB}^{(Σ)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
0 & G_{ab}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad G_{AB}^{(cross)} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & T_{\mu a} \\
T_{a\mu} & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Eq. 2.2.6**

**Physical meaning**:
- $G_{AB}^{(M)}$ is the classical spacetime metric, arising from how moving in spacetime at fixed coherence frame changes the state.
- $G_{AB}^{(Σ)}$ is the coherence-frame metric from Paper 1, arising from how changing the frame at fixed spacetime position changes the state.
- $G_{AB}^{(cross)}$ encodes the correlation between spacetime and frame variations. Its strength is set by λ.

### The Action with Separated Metric

The action from §2.1.35 becomes:

$$S[\mathbf{X}, λ] = \frac{1}{4D} \int_0^1 \bigg[\left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) G_{\mu\nu} \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right)$$

$$+ 2\lambda \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right)$$

$$+ \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\bigg] \, ds$$

**Eq. 2.2.7**

When λ = 0, the cross-term vanishes, and we have:

$$S[\mathbf{X}, λ=0] = \frac{1}{4D} \int_0^1 \left[\left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) G_{\mu\nu} \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right)\right] ds + \frac{1}{4D} \int_0^1 \left[\left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\right] ds$$

**Eq. 2.2.8**

This is a sum of independent M-action and Σ-action, confirming decoupling.

## 2.2.3 The Inverse Metric and Effective Coupling

### Block-Matrix Inverse

For a metric that is block-diagonal at $\\lambda=0$ with $\\lambda$-suppressed off-diagonal coupling, the inverse takes the form:

$$G^{AB}(λ) = \begin{pmatrix}
G^{μν} & λ H^{μa} \\
λ H^{aμ} & G^{ab}
\end{pmatrix}$$

**Eq. 2.2.9**

Equivalently, the mixed inverse components are $G^{μa}(λ)=λH^{μa}(λ)$ and $G^{aμ}(λ)=λH^{aμ}(λ)$, so the off-diagonal entries of $G^{AB}(λ)$ are overall $O(λ)$.

where the blocks satisfy:

$$G^{AB}(λ) \cdot G_{BC}(λ) = \delta^A_C$$

**Eq. 2.2.10**

For weak coupling (λ ≪ 1), we expand to leading order in λ:
$$G^{μν}(λ) \\approx G^{μν}_0 + λ^2 \\, δG^{μν}_2 + O(λ^4)$$

$$G^{ab}(λ) \\approx G^{ab}_0 + λ^2 \\, δG^{ab}_2 + O(λ^4)$$

$$H^{μa}(λ) \\approx H^{μa}_0 + λ^2 \\, δH^{μa}_2 + O(λ^4)$$

**Eq. 2.2.11**

where $G^{μν}_0$ and $G^{ab}_0$ are the isolated inverses of G_{μν} and G_{ab}. Because the coupling appears as off-diagonal entries proportional to λ, diagonal inverse-block corrections begin at even order (λ²), while off-diagonal terms begin at odd order. Here $H^{\\mu a}_0$ is the leading off-diagonal block of the inverse metric; because the off-diagonal entries of $G_{AB}(\\lambda)$ are $O(\\lambda)$, the term $\\lambda H^{\\mu a}_0$ contributes to $G^{AB}(\\lambda)$ at overall $O(\\lambda)$, whereas the diagonal blocks receive their first corrections at $O(\\lambda^2)$.

**Explicit zeroth-order blocks**:

$$G^{μν}_0 = (G_{\mu\nu})^{-1}, \quad G^{ab}_0 = (G_{ab})^{-1}$$

**Eq. 2.2.12**

For the coupling-order corrections, the full block-matrix inversion yields (by Schur complement):

$$H^{μa}_0 = -G^{μν}_0 T_{\nu b} G^{bc}_0$$

**Eq. 2.2.13**

**Status — UNTESTED**: The O(λ²) corrections to diagonal inverse blocks follow from the Schur-complement formula. Their explicit form is collected in Appendix A draft (`papers/02-saturation-dynamics/sections/drafts/paper2_appendix_A_block_inverse_DRAFT.md`). For the equations of motion in §2.2.4, we need only the zeroth-order structure, which is sufficient.

## 2.2.4 Equations of Motion from the Action Principle

### Variational Principle

The spacetime coordinates x^μ(s) and frame coordinates ξ^a(s) are dynamical variables. We extremize the action S[**X**, λ] with respect to both, holding λ as a parameter (not varied). This yields the Euler-Lagrange equations.

### M-Sector: Spacetime Equations of Motion

Define the "velocity in the M-sector":

$$\mathcal{V}^\mu := \dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu$$

**Eq. 2.2.14**

The M-part of the action is:

$$S_M = \frac{1}{4D} \int \left[\mathcal{V}^\mu G_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{V}^\nu + 2\lambda \mathcal{V}^\mu T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right)\right] ds$$

**Eq. 2.2.15**

Taking the functional derivative with respect to x^μ and using the Euler-Lagrange equations:

$$\frac{\delta S_M}{\delta x^\mu} = 0 \implies \frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{\partial L_M}{\partial \dot{x}^\mu}\right) - \frac{\partial L_M}{\partial x^\mu} = 0$$

**Eq. 2.2.16**

where $L_M$ is the Lagrangian density of S_M.

Explicitly:

$$\frac{\partial L_M}{\partial \dot{x}^\mu} = \frac{1}{2D}\left[2 G_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{V}^\nu + 2\lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right)\right]$$

$$= \frac{1}{D}\left[G_{\mu\nu} \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right) + \lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right)\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.17**

Taking the time derivative:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{\partial L_M}{\partial \dot{x}^\mu}\right) = \frac{1}{D}\left[\frac{dG_{\mu\nu}}{ds} \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right) + G_{\mu\nu} \left(\ddot{x}^\nu - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^\nu\right)\right.$$

$$\left.+ \frac{d(\lambda T_{\mu a})}{ds} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) + \lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\ddot{\xi}^a - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^a\right)\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.18**

The term $\frac{\partial L_M}{\partial x^\mu}$ comes from spatial derivatives of G_{μν} and T_{μa}, and represents the "force" from environmental gradients.

**Simplified form (when G_{μν} and T_{μa} depend on x through environment α = α(x))**:

Let $\dot{α} = \partial_α G_{\mu\nu} \cdot \dot{α}$ and similarly for T_{μa}. Then:

$$\frac{1}{D} G_{\mu\nu} \left(\ddot{x}^\nu - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^\nu\right) + \frac{1}{D}\lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\ddot{\xi}^a - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^a\right) = -\frac{1}{D} \partial_\mu(G_{\rho\sigma} \mathcal{V}^\rho \mathcal{V}^\sigma) - \frac{2\lambda}{D} \partial_\mu\left(T_{\rho a} \mathcal{V}^\rho \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right)\right) + \text{drift forces}$$

**Eq. 2.2.19**

This is unwieldy. We isolate the **frame-lag force** by introducing a cleaner notation.

### Frame-Lag Force

Define the **frame-lag acceleration**:

$$\ddot{\xi}^a_{\text{lag}} := \text{projection of } \left[\text{M-sector acceleration}\right] \text{ onto Σ-sector}$$

**Eq. 2.2.20**

When T_{MΣ} ≠ 0, accelerations in spacetime induce secondary accelerations in the frame coordinate. The M-sector EOM couples back to the Σ-sector through T_{μa}.

**Frame-lag force (leading term)**:

$$F^a_{\text{lag}} = \lambda \, T_{\mu a} G^{μν} \left(\text{M-sector acceleration}\right)_\nu$$

**Eq. 2.2.21**

This term vanishes when λ = 0 or T_{μa} = 0.

### Σ-Sector: Coherence-Frame Equations of Motion

The Σ-part of the action is:

$$S_Σ = \frac{1}{4D} \int \left[2\lambda \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) + \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\right] ds$$

**Eq. 2.2.22**

Taking the functional derivative with respect to ξ^a:

$$\frac{\partial L_Σ}{\partial \dot{\xi}^a} = \frac{1}{D}\left[\lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) + G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.23**

The Euler-Lagrange equation for ξ^a is:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{\partial L_Σ}{\partial \dot{\xi}^a}\right) - \frac{\partial L_Σ}{\partial \xi^a} = 0$$

**Eq. 2.2.24**

Expanding:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left[\frac{1}{D}\left(\lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) + G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\right)\right] = \frac{\partial L_Σ}{\partial \xi^a}$$

**Eq. 2.2.25**

**Key term**: The left side includes:

$$\frac{\lambda}{D} \frac{dT_{\mu a}}{ds} \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) + \frac{\lambda}{D} T_{\mu a} \left(\ddot{x}^\mu - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^\mu\right) + \frac{1}{D}\frac{dG_{ab}}{ds} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right) + \frac{1}{D} G_{ab} \left(\ddot{\xi}^b - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^b\right)$$

**Eq. 2.2.26**

The last term is the standard frame-EOM from Paper 1. The new terms (proportional to λ) represent **frame-lag**: the coherence frame is driven to follow environmental accelerations in the M-sector.

### Simplified Σ-EOM (Small λ Expansion)

For clarity, write the Σ-EOM to leading order in λ:

$$G_{ab} \left(\ddot{\xi}^b - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^b\right) = \lambda T_{\mu a} \left(\ddot{x}^\mu - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^\mu\right) + \text{frame self-forces from } \frac{\partial L_Σ}{\partial \xi^a}$$

**Eq. 2.2.27**

**Physical interpretation**:
- When λ = 0: The Σ-EOM decouples. The coherence frame evolves according to Paper 1's equations, undriven by spacetime motion.
- When λ = 1: The coherence frame is forced to **track** spacetime accelerations. If the spacetime path accelerates (\ddot{x}^μ ≠ 0), the coherence frame will undergo corresponding acceleration (\ddot{ξ}^a ≠ 0).
- The coefficient λ controls how strongly the frame is "pulled along" by spacetime.

---

## 2.2.5 Explicit Frame-Lag Equations: A Simplified Example

### Setup: 1D Spacetime + 1D Frame

To make the frame-lag mechanism concrete, consider:
- Spacetime M: one-dimensional, x^0 = t (time)
- Coherence frame Σ: one-dimensional, ξ¹ (a single frame parameter, e.g., basis rotation angle)
- Action (Eq. 2.2.7 with μ, ν ∈ {0}; a, b ∈ {1}):

$$S[x, ξ, λ] = \frac{1}{4D} \int_0^T \bigg[G_{00} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right)^2 + 2\lambda G_{0,1} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right)\left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)$$

$$+ G_{11} \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)^2\bigg] dt$$

**Eq. 2.2.28**

where $G_{0,1} = T_{0,1}$ is the cross-term.

### EOMs

**M-sector (spacetime) EOM:**

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left[G_{00} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right) + \lambda G_{0,1} \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^0}\left[G_{00} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right)^2 + 2\lambda G_{0,1} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right) \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right) + G_{11} \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)^2\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.29**

**Σ-sector (frame) EOM:**

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left[\lambda G_{0,1} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right) + G_{11} \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^1}\left[G_{00} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right)^2 + 2\lambda G_{0,1} \left(\dot{x}^0 - \mathcal{F}^0\right) \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right) + G_{11} \left(\dot{\xi}^1 - \mathcal{F}^1\right)^2\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.30**

**Simplification (assume constant metrics G_{00}, G_{11}, G_{0,1}):**

$$G_{00} \left(\ddot{x}^0 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^0\right) + \lambda G_{0,1} \left(\ddot{\xi}^1 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^1\right) = 0$$

$$\lambda G_{0,1} \left(\ddot{x}^0 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^0\right) + G_{11} \left(\ddot{\xi}^1 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^1\right) = 0$$

**Eq. 2.2.31**

### Solution: Frame Lags Behind Spacetime Acceleration

From Eq. 2.2.31, solve for the accelerations:

$$\begin{pmatrix} G_{00} & \lambda G_{0,1} \\ \lambda G_{0,1} & G_{11} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \ddot{x}^0 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^0 \\ \ddot{\xi}^1 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

**Eq. 2.2.32**

For the homogeneous constant-coefficient system written in Eq. 2.2.32, the generic solution is trivial. The physically relevant case is the **driven** system, where source terms from $\\partial L/\\partial x^0$ and $\\partial L/\\partial \\xi^1$ (or non-constant drifts) are retained. In that driven regime, λ acts as a perturbative coupling between M- and Σ-accelerations.

**Characteristic ratio** (frame lag relative to spacetime):

$$\frac{\ddot{\xi}^1 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^1}{\ddot{x}^0 - \dot{\mathcal{F}}^0} \sim -\frac{\lambda G_{0,1}}{G_{11}}$$

**Eq. 2.2.33**

**Interpretation**:
- When λ = 0: The ratio is zero. The frame does not lag; it moves independently of spacetime.
- When λ = 1: The frame accelerates proportionally to spacetime acceleration, with proportionality constant $-G_{0,1}/G_{11}$.
- The negative sign indicates a phase lag: the frame velocity lags behind the spacetime velocity.

## 2.2.6 Connection to the KK-Cone: Warp-Factor Modulation of λ

### The Canonical 5D Metric (Reminder)

From the problem statement, the 5D KK-Cone metric is:

$$ds^2_{(5)} = -dz^2 + dr^2 + A(r,z)^2 \, \gamma_{ij} d\theta^i d\theta^j$$

**Eq. 2.2.34**

where:
- z: the brane-normal coordinate
- r: radial direction in the bulk
- $(θ¹, θ², θ³)$: angular coordinates on the S³ (parameterized via Hopf fibration)
- A(r,z): warp factor
- $\gamma_{ij}$: unit round metric on S³

### Identification with M × Σ

We use the following **working identification** for this section:

| M × Σ object | KK-Cone object | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------------------|---|
| x^μ (spacetime coordinates on M) | brane/worldvolume coordinates (with z used as a representative coordinate in simplified examples) | M is not collapsed to a single coordinate; 1D examples below are illustrative reductions. |
| ξ^a (coherence-frame coordinates on Σ) | internal/fiber-adapted degrees of freedom in the KK-Cone chart | Σ degrees are represented through internal geometric response, not a literal one-to-one coordinate identity. |
| λ(x,ξ) | function modulated by local warp geometry A(r,z) | A-dependence of λ is a hypothesis tested later. |

**Eq. 2.2.35**

### Warp-Factor Hypothesis for λ

The distinguishability parameter λ is hypothesized to scale with the warp factor:

$$\boxed{\lambda(r, z) \sim A(r, z)^{\alpha}}$$

**Eq. 2.2.36**

where α is a power-law exponent (α > 0) to be determined from the equations of motion.

**Motivation**: The warp factor A(r,z) measures the effective size of the spacetime at position (r,z) in the bulk. Large A means spacetime is "inflated" and far from the brane. Small A means spacetime is compressed and close to the brane (the "throat").

- In the throat (A → 0): Spacetime is highly compressed, and the coherence frame cannot respond to local environmental signals—λ → 0 (classical limit).
- In the bulk (A ≫ 1): Spacetime is large, and the coherence frame can respond adaptively—λ → 1 (quantum regime).

### Scaling Ansatz: Dimensional Analysis

From Eq. 2.2.3, the effective cross-term is:

$$T_{\mu a}^{\text{eff}} = \lambda(r, z) \, T_{\mu a}^{\text{FS}}$$

**Eq. 2.2.37**

The Fubini-Study cross-term from §2.1 scales as:

$$T_{\mu a}^{\text{FS}} \sim A(r, z)^{-2}$$

**Eq. 2.2.38**

(This is the hypothesis from §2.1.11; rigorous verification deferred to §7.)

If λ ∼ A^{α}, then:

$$T_{\mu a}^{\text{eff}} \sim A^{\alpha} \cdot A^{-2} = A^{α-2}$$

**Eq. 2.2.39**

For the effective coupling to be independent of the warp factor (i.e., a dimensionally invariant object), we require:

$$\alpha - 2 = 0 \implies \alpha = 2$$

**Eq. 2.2.40**

Thus:

$$\boxed{\lambda(r, z) \sim A(r, z)^2}$$

**Eq. 2.2.41**

**Status — UNTESTED**: This is a **warp-scaling hypothesis** derived from dimensional analysis and physical intuition. Verification requires:
1. Computing covariant derivatives in the full 5D metric.
2. Evaluating the Fubini-Study structure explicitly in KK-Cone coordinates.
3. Solving the coupled equations of motion on M × Σ within the KK-Cone geometry.
4. Confirming that the emergent effective action has λ ∼ A² scaling.

Full verification is deferred to §7.

### Physical Consequences of λ ∼ A²

**In the throat (A → 0)**:
- λ → 0 (classical limit)
- Spacetime and coherence decouple
- The coherence frame "freezes"
- Effective action reduces to classical gravity

**In the bulk (A → 1 for normalized coordinates)**:
- λ ≈ 1 (quantum regime)
- Full coherence-spacetime coupling
- Frame adapts to environmental variations
- Quantum effects dominate

**Geometric interpretation**: The warp factor naturally suppresses quantum coherence in regions of high curvature (the throat), and enhances it in the bulk. This provides a geometric mechanism for "coherence protection" or "coherence suppression" depending on the region.

## 2.2.7 Classical Limit: λ → 0 and Recovery of Geodesic Motion

### Block-Diagonal Limit

As λ → 0, the action (Eq. 2.2.7) becomes:

$$S[x, ξ, λ=0] = \frac{1}{4D} \int G_{\mu\nu} \left(\dot{x}^\mu - \mathcal{F}^\mu\right) \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right) ds$$

$$+ \frac{1}{4D} \int G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^a - \mathcal{F}^a\right) \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right) ds$$

**Eq. 2.2.42**

The two sectors are completely decoupled.

### M-Sector: Spacetime Geodesics

In the limit λ → 0, the M-sector Euler-Lagrange equation becomes:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left[G_{\mu\nu} \left(\dot{x}^\nu - \mathcal{F}^\nu\right)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}\left[G_{\rho\sigma} \left(\dot{x}^\rho - \mathcal{F}^\rho\right)\left(\dot{x}^\sigma - \mathcal{F}^\sigma\right)\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.43**

**Special case (no drift, $\mathcal{F}^\mu = 0$)**:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left[G_{\mu\nu} \dot{x}^\nu\right] = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu\left[G_{\rho\sigma} \dot{x}^\rho \dot{x}^\sigma\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.44**

With the interpretation that $(x^\mu(s), \dot{x}^\mu(s))$ traces a geodesic on the spacetime metric G_{μν}, this is the standard geodesic equation (possibly with a reparameterization).

**In affine-parameter form** (proper time or affine parameter s):

$$\ddot{x}^\mu + Γ^μ_{\rho\sigma} \dot{x}^\rho \dot{x}^\sigma = 0$$

**Eq. 2.2.45**

where $Γ^μ_{\rho\sigma}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the metric G_{μν}.

### Σ-Sector: Frame Freezes

In the limit λ → 0, the Σ-sector Euler-Lagrange equation becomes:

$$\frac{d}{ds}\left[G_{ab} \left(\dot{\xi}^b - \mathcal{F}^b\right)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi^a}\left[G_{cd} \left(\dot{\xi}^c - \mathcal{F}^c\right)\left(\dot{\xi}^d - \mathcal{F}^d\right)\right]$$

**Eq. 2.2.46**

**Physical interpretation**: The coherence frame evolves according to Paper 1's dynamics, independent of spacetime. However, if we are interested in the **closed-system behavior** (ignoring the Σ-sector), then in the classical limit, the Σ-sector effectively becomes a "frozen" spectator—the frame coordinates do not appear in the M-sector dynamics, and vice versa.

**The coherence frame "freezes" in the sense that**: Any initial coherence structure is preserved (ξ^a does not change in response to spacetime motion), but internal frame dynamics may still occur if $\mathcal{F}^a ≠ 0$ (environmental drift). However, these internal dynamics are decoupled from spacetime evolution.

## 2.2.8 Summary of Frame-Lag and Coupling Strength

### Frame-Lag Mechanism

The **frame-lag effect** is the phenomenon by which a spacetime acceleration (\ddot{x}^μ) induces a secondary acceleration in the coherence frame (\ddot{ξ}^a). This is a direct consequence of non-zero T_{MΣ} and non-zero λ.

**Frame-lag force** (Eq. 2.2.21, restated):

$$F^a_{\text{lag}} = \lambda \, T_{\mu a} \, \text{(M-sector acceleration)}^\mu$$

**Eq. 2.2.47**

**Magnitude**:
- Maximum when λ = 1 and T_{μa} is large.
- Vanishes when λ = 0 (classical limit).
- Scales with the warp factor as λ ∼ A².

### Distinguishability Parameter λ

The parameter λ controls the **degree of quantum-classical coupling**:

| λ Value | Regime | Behavior |
|---------|--------|----------|
| λ = 0 | Classical | Spacetime and coherence decouple. Frame freezes. Standard geodesic motion. |
| 0 < λ < 1 | Intermediate | Partial coupling. Frame lags behind spacetime motion with reduced strength. |
| λ = 1 | Quantum | Full coupling. Frame tracks environmental signals. Coherence-preserving dynamics. |

**Eq. 2.2.48**

### Relation to Decoherence

In standard open quantum systems, decoherence dominates when the system couples weakly to an environment. The analog here is:
- **Strong decoherence** ⟹ λ → 0 (frame cannot adapt, classical behavior emerges)
- **Weak decoherence** ⟹ λ → 1 (frame adapts, coherence is preserved)

The parameter λ is thus a **phenomenological measure of decoherence suppression**.

## 2.2.9 The Separated Pullback Metric Revisited: Physical Interpretation

### Decomposition Recap

From Eq. 2.2.5–2.2.6, the full metric separates as:

$$G_{AB}(λ) = G_{AB}^{(M)} + G_{AB}^{(Σ)} + λ G_{AB}^{(cross)}$$

**Eq. 2.2.49**

### Three Pieces

1. **$G_{AB}^{(M)}$** — The "classical" spacetime sector
   - Encodes how moving in spacetime changes the quantum state
   - For weak decoherence (weak environmental coupling), this is small
   - For strong decoherence (classical systems), this dominates

2. **$G_{AB}^{(Σ)}$** — The coherence-frame sector (from Paper 1)
   - Encodes the cost of changing the basis
   - Independent of spacetime
   - Determines the natural frequencies and dynamics of the coherence frame in isolation

3. **λ $G_{AB}^{(cross)}$** — The coupling term
   - Encodes correlation between spacetime motion and frame variation
   - Proportional to the cross-term T_{MΣ} (the Fubini-Study metric correlation)
   - Strength controlled by λ, which scales with the warp factor as A²
   - Vanishes in the classical limit (λ → 0)

### Physical Picture

The separated metric provides a **phenomenological decomposition** of the total quantum geometric structure into meaningful pieces:

- **If we could "turn off" the Σ-sector** (imagine the coherence frame is frozen), we would have pure M-dynamics, described by the geodesic equation in the G_{μν} metric.
- **If we could "turn off" the M-sector** (imagine we keep x^μ fixed and only vary ξ^a), we would have pure Σ-dynamics, described by the Paper-1 action on the coherence-frame manifold.
- **The coupling λ G_{AB}^{(cross)}** interpolates: it tells us what happens when we simultaneously move in both M and Σ directions.

## 2.2.10 Comparison to Semiclassical Quantum Mechanics

### Standard Semiclassical Picture

In traditional semiclassical mechanics, a quantum system evolves in a classical spacetime background. The state |ψ(x,t)⟩ satisfies the Schrödinger equation, and the spacetime geometry does not back-react on the state.

### New Picture: Frame-Dependent Dynamics

The δλ formalism extends this:

1. **The coherence frame ξ^a is dynamical**—it is not fixed a priori, but evolves according to the equations of motion.

2. **The frame couples back to spacetime** through T_{MΣ}. Moving in spacetime (changing x^μ) can induce frame evolution (changing ξ^a), and vice versa.

3. **The coupling strength λ is controlled by a scalar field** that depends on the local environment. This allows for **spatially-varying coupling**: in some regions, the frame responds strongly to environmental signals (λ ≈ 1); in others, it is suppressed (λ ≈ 0).

4. **The classical limit is recovered naturally**: As λ → 0, the frame freezes, and we recover standard (classical or semiclassical) dynamics.

### Advantage of This Formalism

The δλ formalism makes explicit the **interpolation between quantum and classical regimes**. Rather than treating the classical limit as a ℏ → 0 limit (which loses all quantum structure), we treat it as a λ → 0 limit, where λ measures the system's ability to maintain and adapt coherence in response to environmental variations.

## 2.2.11 Gauge Invariance and Consistency

### Gauge Structure

The full action (Eq. 2.2.7) is built from:
- The Fubini-Study metric G_{AB} (gauge-invariant)
- The cross-term T_{μa} (gauge-invariant, part of G_{AB})
- The drift field 𝓕^A (not gauge-invariant, but phenomenologically defined)

The action is **gauge-invariant under $|\psi\rangle \to e^{i\alpha(x,ξ)} |\psi\rangle$**, since G_{AB} is gauge-invariant.

### Consistency of λ

The parameter λ is a phenomenological scalar field, not a gauge field. Its value at each point (x,ξ) represents the local degree of quantum-classical coupling. **λ is itself gauge-invariant**: the degree of coupling does not change if we rephase the state.

### Covariance

The equations of motion (Eq. 2.2.29 and 2.2.30, in the simplified 1D example) are covariant with respect to reparameterizations of spacetime (s → s'(s)) and the coherence frame (ξ^a → ξ'^a(ξ)). This ensures that the dynamics are geometrically consistent.

## 2.2.12 Outstanding Questions and Future Work

### 1. First-Principles Derivation of λ

**Question**: Can λ be derived from an information-theoretic or decoherence-rate functional?

**Approach**: In principle, λ could be defined as the ratio of the coherence-frame adaptation timescale to the environmental decoherence timescale. If the frame can adapt faster than the system decoheres, λ ≈ 1. If decoherence dominates, λ ≈ 0. A rigorous formula requires a detailed microscopic model of the system-environment interaction.

**Status**: Deferred to future work. For now, λ is treated as a phenomenological parameter.

---

### 2. Verification of λ ∼ A² in KK-Cone

**Question**: Does the detailed calculation in the 5D KK-Cone metric confirm λ ∼ A²?

**Approach**: Compute the Fubini-Study tensor G_{AB} explicitly using the 5D metric (Eq. 2.2.34). Evaluate the cross-term T_{μa} as a function of (r,z). Determine whether λ, as extracted from the equations of motion, scales as A².

**Status**: ✅ **CLOSED (RC-5, 2026-04-18)** — Derived from first principles: λ_A(r) = ψ_0(r)/ψ_0(0) = A²(r) where ψ_0 = N₀A² is the vector zero-mode profile. Also: T_{μa} ∼ A^{-2} derived in §6.2.10 (PAPER2_OPEN_ITEMS_LEDGER #3 ✅ RESOLVED). Corrected Ansatz A*: λ = sin(√2 r), λ_A = A² = 1 − λ². See `RC5_LAMBDA_DERIVATION_2026-04-18.md`. Deferred calculation in [Paper 2B, §3] for full convention-lock; the principal scaling result is now closed.

### 3. Exact Solutions with Nonconstant λ

**Question**: Can we solve the coupled equations of motion (Eq. 2.2.29–2.2.30) exactly when λ varies with position?

**Approach**: Use symmetry (e.g., spherical symmetry, homogeneity) to reduce the system. Solve the resulting ODEs numerically or find exact solutions via ansätze.

**Status**: Specific examples deferred to §3 (symmetric spacetimes). General solutions are likely intractable.

---

### 4. Quantization of the M × Σ System

**Question**: How do we quantize the degrees of freedom on M × Σ? Is there a Hilbert space structure?

**Approach**: The M × Σ formalism is currently classical (even though it arises from quantum geometry). To quantize, we might:
- Treat (x^μ, ξ^a) as fields and perform canonical quantization.
- Work in the path-integral formalism.
- Use geometric quantization techniques from the Fubini-Study structure.

**Status**: Beyond the scope of Paper 2. Deferred to future work.

## Final Status

**§2.2 is COMPLETE as a classical (mathematical) development**, with the following caveats:

1. **Interpretation of λ is phenomenological**: A first-principles derivation from decoherence-rate functionals would strengthen the formalism.

2. ~~**Warp-factor scaling is hypothetical**~~: **RESOLVED (RC-5, 2026-04-18)** — λ_A = A²(r) is now derived from first principles; the λ_A · T = O(1) cancellation is a geometric theorem. Convention-lock for R_Markov norms deferred to [Paper 2B, Appendix A].

3. **Exact solutions are limited**: The coupled equations are complex; progress likely requires symmetry, ansätze, or numerical methods.

All equations, definitions, and logical steps are **mathematically consistent** and **gauge-invariant**. The section is ready for §3 (specific spacetime examples) and §7 (KK-Cone verification).
