## §4.1 The Euler-Lagrange System on General M × Σ

### §4.1.1 Setup

The formalism developed in §2.1–§2.2 defines a joint manifold M × Σ carrying the Fubini-Study metric $G_{AB}$ from the state map $\Phi: M \times \Sigma \to \mathcal{P}\mathcal{H}$. We now derive the equations of motion for trajectories on this manifold.

The metric decomposes in block form (Eq. 2.1.6):

$$G_{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} G_{\mu\nu}^{(M)} & T_{\mu a} \\ T_{a\mu} & G_{ab}^{(\Sigma)} \end{pmatrix} \tag{4.1.1}$$

where:
- $G_{\mu\nu}^{(M)}$ is the M-sector metric (spacetime)
- $G_{ab}^{(\Sigma)}$ is the Σ-sector metric (coherence frame)
- $T_{\mu a}$ is the cross-term tensor from the Fubini-Study pullback (§2.1)

The cross-term $T_{\mu a}$ couples M-sector dynamics to Σ-sector evolution. Its presence is the essential new feature of the coherence-frame formalism: spacetime motion and coherence evolution are not independent.

### §4.1.2 State Parameterization (General Framework)

To compute $T_{\mu a}$, we must specify how the quantum state depends on position in M × Σ.

**General setting:** The quantum state is the ground state of an effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H}(x, \xi)$ that depends on both the M-sector position $x \in M$ and the Σ-sector coordinate $\xi \in \Sigma$. As the system moves through M × Σ, the ground state evolves adiabatically:

$$\partial_a |\psi\rangle = \frac{d}{d\xi^a} |\psi(\text{ground state at } \xi)\rangle \tag{4.1.2}$$

$$\partial_\mu |\psi\rangle = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} |\psi(\text{ground state at } x, \xi)\rangle \tag{4.1.3}$$

The Fubini-Study cross-term is then:

$$T_{\mu a} = \text{Re}\left[\langle \partial_\mu \psi | \partial_a \psi \rangle - \langle \partial_\mu \psi | \psi \rangle \langle \psi | \partial_a \psi \rangle\right] \tag{4.1.4}$$

For adiabatic ground states with $\langle \psi | \partial_a \psi \rangle = 0$ (real wavefunctions), this simplifies to:

$$T_{\mu a} = \text{Re}\left[\langle \partial_\mu \psi | \partial_a \psi \rangle\right] \tag{4.1.5}$$

### §4.1.3 Cross-Term Scaling: The General Argument

When the Hamiltonian decomposes as:

$$\hat{H}(x, \xi) = \hat{H}_M(x) + W(\xi) \, \hat{H}_\Sigma(\xi) + \text{interaction} \tag{4.1.6}$$

where $W(\xi)$ is a function of the Σ-sector coordinate that sets the relative energy scale, the cross-term scales as:

$$|T_{\mu a}| \sim W(\xi)^{-1} \times \text{(coupling strength)} \tag{4.1.7}$$

This scaling arises because excited states in Σ — which give non-trivial $\partial_a |\psi_\Sigma\rangle$ — have energy gaps of order $W(\xi)$ due to the rescaling in (4.1.6). The inverse dependence on $W$ is a general consequence of the adiabatic perturbation theory.

**Key point:** The specific function $W(\xi)$ depends on the geometry. For a warped product with warp factor $A$, one expects $W \sim A^{-2}$ (the standard warped-mode scaling), giving $T_{\mu a} \sim A^{-2}$. But this identification requires solving the mode equation on the specific geometry — it cannot be established at the framework level.

### §4.1.4 The General Equations of Motion

From the Euler-Lagrange variation of the action (Eq. 2.2.7) on M × Σ, the equations of motion are:

**M-sector:**
$$\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{ds^2} + \Gamma_{\nu\rho}^{(M)\mu} \frac{dx^\nu}{ds} \frac{dx^\rho}{ds} = \lambda \, T^{\mu a} \frac{d^2\xi^a}{ds^2} + \text{(frame-lag terms)} \tag{4.1.8}$$

**Σ-sector:**
$$\frac{d^2 \xi^a}{ds^2} + \Gamma_{bc}^{(\Sigma)a} \frac{d\xi^b}{ds} \frac{d\xi^c}{ds} = \lambda \, T^{a\mu} \frac{d^2 x^\mu}{ds^2} + \text{(interaction terms)} \tag{4.1.9}$$

where:
- $\Gamma^{(M)}$ and $\Gamma^{(\Sigma)}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the M and Σ metrics respectively
- $T^{\mu a} = G^{(M)\mu\nu} G^{(\Sigma)ab} T_{\nu b}$ is the upper-index cross-term
- $\lambda$ is the distinguishability parameter from §2.2
- The "frame-lag terms" include the force $F_{\text{lag}}^a$ from Eq. 2.2.29

The structure of (4.1.8)–(4.1.9) is a *coupled geodesic system*: the M-sector trajectory is sourced by Σ-sector acceleration (and vice versa), with the coupling mediated by the cross-term tensor and modulated by $\lambda$.

### §4.1.5 The Frame-Lag Mechanism

The frame-lag force (Eq. 2.2.29) takes the general form:

$$F_{\text{lag}}^a = \lambda \, T^{a\mu} \, G_{\mu\nu}^{(M)} \, a^\nu \tag{4.1.10}$$

where $a^\nu = d^2 x^\nu / ds^2$ is the M-sector acceleration.

**Physical interpretation:** When the M-sector system accelerates — for example, under the influence of a spacetime force — the coherence frame responds. The cross-term $T^{a\mu}$ transmits the acceleration into Σ-sector dynamics, creating a "lag" between the spacetime trajectory and the coherence evolution.

This is a *universal mechanism*: it follows from the coupled structure of Eqs. (4.1.8)–(4.1.9) and does not depend on the specific geometry. Any manifold M × Σ carrying a non-trivial cross-term will exhibit frame-lag.

The effective coupling strength of the frame-lag is the product $\lambda \cdot T^{a\mu}$. Individually, both $\lambda$ and $T^{a\mu}$ may depend strongly on the Σ-sector coordinate. Whether their product is bounded, divergent, or vanishing is a *geometry-dependent* question — it depends on how $\lambda$ and $T$ scale with the warp structure.

### §4.1.6 The $\lambda \cdot T$ Consistency Requirement

From the action (Eq. 2.2.7), the coupling between sectors is physical only when:

$$\lambda(\xi) \cdot |T^{a\mu}(\xi)| \text{ is bounded for all } \xi \in \Sigma \tag{4.1.11}$$

This is a necessary condition for the equations of motion to be well-posed. If $\lambda \cdot T$ diverges somewhere in Σ, the frame-lag force becomes infinite and the coupled geodesic system breaks down.

**At the framework level**, we can state this as a *consistency requirement* on admissible geometries: any geometry that supports the coherence-frame formalism must have bounded $\lambda \cdot T$.

Whether $\lambda \cdot T$ is not just bounded but *constant* (independent of $\xi$) is a stronger condition that has been verified in the KK-Cone worked example (§7.4.15 of the companion paper [Paper 2B]), where the warp-factor cancellation gives $\lambda \cdot T = O(1)$. This uniformity is a notable feature of that geometry, not a general theorem.

## §4.2 Where Standard Evaluation Hits Walls

The abstract framework of §4.1 is well-defined: the coupled geodesic equations (4.1.8)–(4.1.9), the frame-lag mechanism (4.1.10), and the $\lambda \cdot T$ consistency requirement (4.1.11) are all stated in terms of the general metric structure. However, *evaluating* these equations on any specific warped geometry exposes several convention dependencies and interpretive challenges that require dedicated treatment.

### §4.2.1 Norm Conventions in the Markov Criterion

The Markov transition criterion (§2.3) defines $R_{\text{Markov}}$ via the Frobenius norm of the M-sector metric:

$$R_{\text{Markov}} = \frac{\|G^{(M)}\|_F}{\|G^{(\Sigma)}\|_F} \tag{4.2.1}$$

At the framework level, this ratio is well-defined: it compares M-sector curvature to Σ-sector curvature using a coordinate-invariant norm (§2.3, Definition 2.3.1).

When evaluated on a specific warped geometry, a convention choice arises: should $\|G^{(M)}\|_F$ be computed from the covariant metric $G_{\mu\nu}$, the contravariant metric $G^{\mu\nu}$, or a mixed convention?

**The norm-audit finding (three-model consensus):** Under all geometrically consistent conventions, $R_{\text{Markov}}$ in warped throats approaches $O(1)$, not zero or infinity. The underlying mechanism is the $A^2 \cdot A^{-2}$ cancellation: the warp factor enters the covariant and contravariant components with opposite powers, producing $O(1)$ when they are combined in the Frobenius norm.

This is not a defect of $R_{\text{Markov}}$ as a framework quantity. It is a feature of warped geometries: the M-sector curvature and the Σ-sector curvature scale in the same way with the warp factor, so their ratio is insensitive to the warping. The *qualitative* behavior (whether the system classicalizes) is captured not by $R_{\text{Markov}} \to 0$ but by the more robust statement $\lambda \to 0$, which is convention-independent.

### §4.2.2 Cross-Term Scaling Requires Solving the Mode Equation

The general scaling argument (§4.1.3, Eq. 4.1.7) establishes that $T_{\mu a}$ depends inversely on the energy gap $W(\xi)$. But the precise numerical prefactor — and whether the scaling is exactly $W^{-1}$ or involves logarithmic corrections, angular-momentum dependence, or state-mixing effects — requires solving the mode equation on the specific geometry.

For the cross-term to be numerically evaluated, one must:
1. Specify the metric (which determines $W(\xi)$)
2. Solve for the ground-state profile $f_0(\xi)$ via the mode equation
3. Compute the overlap integrals that define $T_{\mu a}$ (Eq. 4.1.4)

None of these steps can be performed at the framework level. They require committing to a geometry.

### §4.2.3 The Coupling Identification $\lambda = f(\text{geometry})$

The distinguishability parameter $\lambda$ was introduced in §2.2 as a control parameter interpolating between fully separated ($\lambda = 0$) and fully coupled ($\lambda = 1$) geometries. In the abstract framework, $\lambda$ is a function on Σ.

The identification $\lambda = f(\text{warp factor})$ is geometry-dependent:
- It requires solving the boundary conditions of the specific geometry
- It depends on the physical interpretation of $\lambda$ (metric perspective vs. dynamical perspective — see the detailed discussion in [Paper 2B, §6.3])
- Different geometries may produce different functional forms

The corrected identification $\lambda = A^2$ (not $A^{-2}$) was established for the KK-Cone in [Paper 2B, Eq. 7.3.3], where the physical requirement is that $\lambda \to 0$ in the classical limit (deep throat). This identification ensures:
- $\lambda = 1$ at the brane (maximal coupling)
- $\lambda \to 0$ at the throat (classical limit)
- The frame-lag force $F_{\text{lag}} \sim \lambda \cdot T \sim O(1)$ (finite)

Whether the same identification holds for other geometries is an open question.

### §4.2.4 The Classical Limit: $\lambda \to 0$ vs. $R_{\text{Markov}} \to 0$

A central question in the coherence-frame formalism is: *under what conditions does the system classicalize?*

Two candidate criteria exist:
1. **$R_{\text{Markov}} \to 0$:** The Markov ratio vanishes, indicating that M-sector curvature dominates. This is the criterion proposed in §2.3.
2. **$\lambda \to 0$:** The coupling parameter vanishes, indicating that M and Σ sectors decouple. This is the criterion suggested by the equations of motion.

The norm-audit results show that these two criteria can diverge on warped geometries. $R_{\text{Markov}}$ is convention-sensitive and tends to $O(1)$ in warped throats. $\lambda \to 0$ is convention-independent (it is a scalar on Σ) and robustly signals classicalization.

**Framework-level conclusion:** The robust statement is:

$$\text{Classical limit} \iff \lambda \to 0 \tag{4.2.2}$$

This is convention-independent and follows directly from the structure of the equations of motion (4.1.8)–(4.1.9): when $\lambda = 0$, the M and Σ sectors decouple, and the M-sector follows a standard geodesic.

The $R_{\text{Markov}}$ criterion remains valuable as a *geometric diagnostic* (it measures the relative curvature scales), but its evaluation requires resolving the norm conventions described in §4.2.1. This resolution is geometry-specific and is carried out for the KK-Cone in [Paper 2B, §3].

| Explicit trajectory solutions $r(s)$ | Requires full potential structure | [Paper 2B, §6.5] |
| Decoherence timescales for specific observables | Requires state specification + metric | [Paper 2B, §6.6] |

### §4.3.3 What This Means

The abstract equations of motion on M × Σ are well-defined and the frame-lag mechanism is robust. The coupled geodesic system (4.1.8)–(4.1.9) is the natural dynamical content of the coherence-frame metric.

But *evaluating* these equations requires committing to a geometry and resolving convention choices. This is not a failure of the framework — it is the expected state of affairs for any geometric theory. General relativity's field equations are abstract; evaluating them requires choosing a spacetime (Schwarzschild, Kerr, FRW, etc.). Similarly, the coherence-frame equations of motion are abstract; evaluating them requires choosing a coherence geometry.

The companion paper [Paper 2B] provides the first such evaluation, specializing to the KK-Cone — the first physically motivated geometry from derived compactification (§3.2). That evaluation reveals: the warp-factor cancellation $\lambda \cdot T = O(1)$, the corrected identification $\lambda = A^2$, and specific predictions for decoherence dynamics. These are geometry-specific results that illustrate the framework's content but do not exhaust it.

**Delivered promise:** *Equations of motion on M × Σ* ✅ — abstract system fully specified (Eqs. 4.1.8–4.1.9); frame-lag mechanism established (Eq. 4.1.10); evaluation deferred to companion paper with explicit justification.
